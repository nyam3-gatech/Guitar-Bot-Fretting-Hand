Work-In-Progress code for a guitar robot project at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
This code processes a MIDI file by extracting the note data and combining them into chords.
Using fitness functions and a routing algorithmn, the code can quickly determine the optimal fingerings for each chord.
This data is used to control the motions of a robotic arm and other motors on the robot.
